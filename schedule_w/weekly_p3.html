    <h1>❸ Collaborative Weeks!</h1>
  </a>

  <p>
    Like gardeners, we each cultivate our own territory. This territory continues to develop not only during university but also after graduation. As we nurture our territory, we encounter various questions, from practical concerns—such as which designers and studios exist in the field we want to work in—to personal curiosities about what our peers are currently most interested in. It can be challenging for one person to find answers to all these questions alone. To address these questions together, we will create a "Gardeners' Map." This project period also includes several weeks of collaborative efforts. During this time, each of you will take on the role of both leader and supporter. Your collaborative projects will be showcased in the senior exhibition, scheduled from November 10th to November 16th.
